# ClassyLimelights

ClassyLimelights is a library created to give a nicer interface to Limelight hardware than LimelightHelpers. Most of the functionality is the same, but ClassyLimelights does things in a more object-oriented way, which makes it work more like the other libraries commonly used in FRC.
